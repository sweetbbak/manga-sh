# manga-sh
a collection of bash scripts that scrape and download manga/manhwa (currently just asura-scans)

depends on fzf, wget, gum is optional (just replace it with fzf) but its in there for now. This is a first draft so its not very good yet
its stupidly easy to download a chapter from asura with wget, compress it into a zip, rename it to .cbz and open it in a comic book viewer.
or turn it into a pdf but I can never get the spacing between pages to work correctly.
